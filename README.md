# Paper-Summary
A repository for organizing summaries of papers I read. Mostly around Open Vocabulary Object detection, Domain adaptation and Vision Language Models. 

## Domain Adaptation papers
1) [Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks](Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks)

 This work intends to peform classification tasks using representations which are indistinguishable between the source and target domains by a trained domain classifier
